# Magnolia Advanced Tutorial - a light module that uses Magnolia CMS to teach Magnolia light development. 

[Tutorial to appreciate the usefulness of light development in Magnolia CMS]

## Features
[Tutorial explores light development by creating a simple component viz., a page template component that facilitates inclusion of UnSplash photos in a Magnolia content page]


## Usage
[Install the advanced-tutorial-magnolia module from cli:
mgnl install advanced-tutorial-magnolia

This (also) installs a content Bootstrap-tool App.
The Bootstrap-tool takes a file (Absolute) path and a repository name and creates a Content Import Manual Task.
Open the Tasks App and complete the Import.

You may have to use the tool to manually induct the tutorial content.
Hint: Open the Bootstrap-tool app, enter the absolute file system path of website.tutorial-unsplash.xml file at the bootstrap folder of the module.
This inducts the tutorial page.

Also bootstrap dam.tutorial.xml by entering 'dam' instead of 'website' for repository field.

## Contribute to the Magnolia component ecosystem
It's easy to create components for Magnolia and share them on github and npm. I invite you to do so and join the community. Let's stop wasting time by developing the same thing again and again, rather let's help each other out by sharing our work and create a rich library of components.

Just add `magnolia-light-module` as a keyword to npm's package.json to make them easy to find and use on npm.
